## Preview

The Weather Forecast app dynamically changes its background based on the current weather condition. Here are a few examples:

### Warm Weather (Sunny or Clear Sky)

### Cold Weather (Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy)

These dynamic background changes enhance the user experience and provide a visual representation of the current weather conditions.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Get real-time weather information for the user's current location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

- **Hourly Forecast**: View the weather forecast for the next few hours, providing users with detailed information on temperature changes, precipitation, and wind conditions.

- **Weekly Forecast**: Explore the weather forecast for the upcoming week, allowing users to plan their activities accordingly. This includes temperature trends, chance of rain, and other relevant weather details.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for weather information about any city around the globe. Simply enter the desired city name in the search field, and the app will retrieve and display the corresponding weather data.

## How It Works

The app uses a combination of IP geolocation and weather APIs to retrieve the user's IP address and coordinates. With this information, we can accurately determine the user's location and fetch the relevant weather data from our weather service provider.

By leveraging this clever technique, we eliminate the need for users to manually search for their location, providing them with instant access to weather information as soon as they open the app.
